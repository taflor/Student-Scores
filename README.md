# Student Scores
As a former educator, it was always interesting to see the differences in dedication to education at such a young age (6th grade -- 11 to 12 years old). Some students were eager to excel and would seek me out for help, while others would sit back and coast through class. It is up to the teachers to notice these trends, offer extra help, adjust the curriculum, and engage their students. When all of these approaches fail, one wonders why a student falls behind.

Having done some research, I came across <i>The Atlantic's</i> article, ['The 32-Million Word Gap'](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-32-million-word-gap/36856/). A study was done by psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley in the mid-1980's to determine why some students excel while others do not, even after taking part in Head Start, their program for children of America's low-income workers. They collected data on words spoken by students from "three different socioeconomic levels: (1) welfare homes, (2) working-class homes, and (3) professionals' homes".

They found that "Children in professionals' homes were exposed to an average of more than fifteen hundred more spoken words per hour than children in welfare homes. Over one year, that amounted to a difference of nearly 8 million words, which, by age four, amounted to a total gap of 32 million words. They also found a substantial gap in tone and in the complexity of words being used. As they crunched the numbers, they discovered a direct correlation between the intensity of these early verbal experiences and later achievement. "We were astonished at the differences the data revealed," Hart and Risley wrote in their book Meaningful Differences. "The most impressive aspects [are] how different individual families and children are and how much and how important is children's cumulative experience before age 3.""

This study intrigued me and has resulted in this project, where the correlation between attributes within the file will be examined and economic, gender, and course prep data will be used to predict student performance on a test including math, reading, and writing sections.


**Goals**<br>
Examine correlation between different attributes.
Using economic, personal, and course prep data, predict student total score (combination of math, reading, and writing).
